        <h2>Topic 1 – What is “Agentic AI”?</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine a group of helpful little robots that live inside your computer.<br>
            Each robot can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See or hear something new (an e-mail, a spreadsheet row, a picture).</li>
            <li>Think for itself, “What should I do next?”</li>
            <li>Do the work (fetch a file, write a paragraph, send a message) without you clicking anything.</li>
            <li>Talk to the other robots so the whole job gets finished, even if one robot gets stuck.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That whole team working together is called <strong>Agentic AI</strong>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Topic 2 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Topic 2 – A Simple Example</h2>
        <p>
            Let’s use the sprint-report job:
        </p>
        <p>
            Your company just finished a two-week “sprint” (a chunk of work).  
            You want a tidy release note and a pretty e-mail report sent to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of a human copying, pasting and formatting for hours, the robots do it all while you drink coffee.
        </p>

    <!-- Topic 3 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Topic 3 – Meet the Robots One by One</h2>

        <p><span class="robot">Queen-Bee Robot (The Boss)</span><br>
            • <strong>Job:</strong> Make sure the whole mission happens before 5:30 a.m.<br>
            • <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
            – Keeps a little checklist: “Get data → Sort it → Write → Send.”<br>
            – If anything goes wrong (internet hiccup, too many stories), Queen-Bee re-plans on the spot: “Skip the fancy chart, just send text first.”
        </p>

        <p><span class="robot">Gatherer Robot (Collector)</span><br>
            • <strong>Job:</strong> Bring back every single story, bug and code change from your work-tracking board.<br>
            • <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
            – It “asks” the board, “Show me everything we finished this sprint.”<br>
            – If the answer is huge, it automatically breaks the request into smaller pieces so nothing is missed.<br>
            – Double-checks: “Did I get 312 items yesterday and 312 again today? Good, nothing lost.”
        </p>

        <p><span class="robot">Sorter Robot (Classifier)</span><br>
            • <strong>Job:</strong> Put the stories into neat piles: “New features,” “Fixed bugs,” “Behind-the-scenes tech.”<br>
            • <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
            – Reads the title and description of each item.<br>
            – Uses a “smart sticky-note system” (vectors) to see which items feel similar.<br>
            – Adds little warning stickers on risky items: “This one touched lots of files—watch out!”
        </p>

        <p><span class="robot">Writer Robot (Summarizer)</span><br>
            • <strong>Job:</strong> Turn the piles into a friendly release note people actually want to read.<br>
            • <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
            – Starts writing.<br>
            – If the draft is too long, it rewrites shorter sections on its own.<br>
            – Adds emoji or collapsible sections for tech details so both bosses and engineers are happy.
        </p>

        <p><span class="robot">Delivery Robot (Reporter)</span><br>
            • <strong>Job:</strong> Make the final package and e-mail it.<br>
            • <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
            – Draws a simple burndown chart picture.<br>
            – Builds a colorful HTML e-mail.<br>
            – Tries to send. If the mail server is asleep, it quietly tries another route (Teams, or a different server) until the message goes through.
        </p>

    <!-- Topic 4 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Topic 4 – How They Talk to Each Other</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Queen-Bee shouts, “Sprint just ended—start!”</li>
            <li>Gatherer shouts back, “Got everything.”</li>
            <li>Sorter shouts, “Items sorted and labeled.”</li>
            <li>Writer shouts, “Release note ready.”</li>
            <li>Delivery shouts, “E-mail sent—mission complete.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Each robot only worries about its own piece, yet the group reaches the big goal.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Topic 5 -->
    <section>
        <h2>Topic 5 – Why This Feels Magical</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No one has to remember every little step.</li>
            <li>If something changes (maybe next sprint has 800 items instead of 300), the robots adapt without new instructions.</li>
            <li>You wake up, open your inbox, and the report is already there, perfectly formatted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That is <strong>Agentic AI</strong>: a team of small, smart, cooperative robots that finish an entire job on their own.
